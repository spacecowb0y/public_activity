    # == Usage:
    # In model:

    #     tracked
    #   end 
    #
    # In controller

    # changes after creating this {Activity}.
    attr_accessor :activity_params
    @activity_params = {}
    # Set or get owner object responsible for the {Activity}.
    #
    # == Usage:
    # In model:
    #
    #   class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     tracked
    #   end 
    # Controller:
    #
    #   @article = Article.new
    #   @article.activity_owner = current_user # where current_user is an object of logged in user
    #   @article.activity_owner = :author # OR: take @article.author attribute
    #   @article.activity_owner = proc {|o| o.author } # OR: provide a Proc with custom code
    #   @article.save
    #   @article.activities.last.owner #=> Returns owner object
    attr_accessor :activity_owner
    @activity_owner = nil
    # Set or get custom i18n key passed to {Activity}, later used in {Activity#text}
    #
    # == Usage:
    # In model:
    #
    #   class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     tracked
    #   end 
    #
    # In controller:
    #
    #   @article = Article.new
    #   @article.save
    #   @article.activities.last.key #=> "activity.article.create"
    # By default, key looks like "activity.class_name.create|update|destroy"
    #
    # You can customize it, by setting your own key:
    #   @article = Article.new
    #   @article.activity_key = "my.custom.article.key"
    #   @article.save
    #   @article.activities.last.key #=> "my.custom.article.key"

    # Module with basic +tracked+ method that enables tracking models.
    module ClassMethods
      # Adds required callbacks for creating and updating
      # tracked models and adds +activities+ relation for listing
      # associated activities.
      # 
      # == Parameters:
      # [:owner]
      #   Specify the owner of the {Activity} (person responsible for the action).
      #   It can be a Proc, Symbol or an ActiveRecord object:
      #   == Examples:
      #    @article.activity :owner => :author    
      #    @article.activity :owner => {|o| o.author}
      #    @article.activity :owner => User.where(:login => 'piotrek').first
      #   Keep in mind that owner relation is polymorphic, so you can't just provide id number of the owner object.
      # [:params]
      #   Accepts a Hash with custom parameters you want to pass to i18n.translate
      #   method. It is later used in {Activity#text} method.
      #   == Example:
      #    @article.activity :parameters => {:title => @article.title, :short => truncate(@article.text, :length => 50)}
      #   Everything specified here has a lower priority than parameters specified directly in {Tracked::InstanceMethods#activity} method.
      #   So treat it as a place where you provide 'default' values.
      #   For more dynamic settings refer to {Activity} model 
      #   documentation.
      # [:skip_defaults]
      #   Disables recording of activities on create/update/destroy leaving that to programmer's choice. Check {PublicActivity::Common::InstanceMethods#create_activity}
      #   for a guide on how to manually record activities.
